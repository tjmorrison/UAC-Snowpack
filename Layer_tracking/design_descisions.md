# üõ†Ô∏è Design Considerations ‚Äì Snowpack Layer Tracking POC

This document captures the main design decisions, assumptions, and rationale behind the architecture and methods used in the Snowpack Layer Tracking proof-of-concept. It is intended to provide context for further development and inform future architectural choices.

---

## 1. **Scope & Objectives**

* **Purpose:** Deliver a minimal, functional pipeline for automated snowpack layer tracking and event-based analysis using historical snow profile data.
* **POC Focus:** Prioritize rapid prototyping and feasibility over modularity, robustness, or extensibility.

## 2. **Key Design Decisions**

| Decision / Tradeoff                      | Rationale                                                | Impact / Notes                             |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Use of functional script-based workflow  | Simpler for rapid development                            | Reduces modularity; quick iteration        |
| Hard-coded config (paths, params)        | Lower overhead for POC, easier to review/debug           | Not scalable or flexible                   |
| Minimal error handling                   | Faster prototyping                                       | Poor resilience to data/input issues       |
| Static plotting only                     | Simpler implementation, easier for basic QA              | No interactive plots or export flexibility |
| Single-profile focus                     | Reduces complexity for initial demo                      | Not directly scalable to multi-profile     |
| Accumulation period logic prioritized    | Operational relevance, easier validation                 | Dry periods require further development    |
| All-in-one modules (utils, loader, etc.) | Fast prototyping with fewer files to manage              | Needs refactor for maintainability         |
| Numpy/Pandas-based manipulation          | Leverage familiar libraries, high developer productivity | Could be replaced with xarray for scale    |

## 3. **Assumptions**

* Input data is complete and correctly formatted for loader functions
* Event detection thresholds are set appropriately for target datasets
* Downstream users will validate results before operational use
* Output visualizations are sufficient for demonstration purposes

## 4. **Non-Goals**

* Not intended for production use or integration without significant refactoring
* Does not provide robust error handling, data validation, or multi-user support
* Not designed for high performance with very large or streaming datasets
* No automated deployment or cloud integration is included

## 5. **Areas Identified for Future Design**

* **Config management:** Move from hard-coded values to config files or CLI args
* **Data validation:** Implement schema and type checks for inputs/outputs
* **Modularity:** Refactor to split into more granular, reusable modules
* **Scalability:** Adapt code for batch/multi-profile workflows and large data
* **Visualization:** Upgrade to interactive or API-based plotting (Plotly, Dash, etc.)
* **Testing:** Add unit and integration tests for critical logic

## 6. **Open Questions**

* What are the key user stories or operational requirements for productionization?
* Which external systems or APIs must this pipeline interface with in the future?
* How should event and weak layer definitions be standardized for reproducibility?
